# OPEN_DSS Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing electrical system data using Python and visualizing key metrics such as voltage, current, power, and losses. The data is extracted from CSV files generated by the OPEN_DSS simulation tool, and the analysis provides insights into the performance of the electrical network.

The project also includes a `.dss` file that defines the electrical model, including transformers, substations, loads, and lines.

## Features

- **Voltage Analysis**: Visualize per-unit voltage magnitudes (`pu`) across different nodes and buses.
- **Current Analysis**: Analyze and plot current magnitudes for different phases and elements.
- **Power Analysis**: Plot active (`P(kW)`) and reactive (`Q(kvar)`) power for transformers, lines, and loads.
- **Losses Analysis**: Evaluate and visualize `I2R` and `I2X` losses across network elements.

## Data Files

The project uses the following CSV files as input:

1. **`NITK_MainBus_EXP_VOLTAGES.csv`**: Contains voltage data for various buses and nodes.
2. **`NITK_MainBus_EXP_CURRENTS.csv`**: Includes current data for different elements and phases.
3. **`NITK_MainBus_EXP_POWERS.csv`**: Provides active and reactive power data for transformers, lines, and loads.
4. **`NITK_MainBus_EXP_LOSSES.csv`**: Contains loss data (`I2R`, `I2X`) for transformers and lines.

## Visualizations

The project generates the following plots:

1. **Voltage Magnitudes**:
   - Per-unit voltage (`pu`) for Node1, Node2, and Node3 across buses.
   - Annotated plots for better clarity.
2. **Current Magnitudes**:
   - Phase-wise current magnitudes (`I1_1`, `I1_2`, etc.) for elements.
   - Residual currents (`Iresid1`, `Iresid2`) where applicable.
3. **Power Analysis**:
   - Active and reactive power for terminal 1.
   - Active power for line data from terminal 2.
4. **Losses Analysis**:
   - Combined plot of `I2R(W)` and `I2X(var)` losses across elements.
